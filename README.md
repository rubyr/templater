# templater
simple, fast templating system for everyone

## what?

templater is a very simple templating system. As in, it makes and reads templates for any project - starting code. It's useful when you want to be able to begin with a boilerplate, instead of having to run a bunch of `mkdir` and `touch` commands, or whatever.

## why?

Mostly just to pick at the urge I had to write it. But also, because making a template should be easy - *just set up the folders, files, and then export.* Everything gets stored in a single JSON file, which you can do with as you please.

## how?

### To make a template,

- Set up the file structure
- Run `node makeTemplate.js [template root folder] [template name]`

### To copy a template,

- Run `node readTemplate.js [template file] [folder name]`

## who? 

Hi, I'm ruby - I make lots of things. I'm the sole maintainer of this project!
